# FixBit - Enhancement of "Fix" Pebble watchface

## About

The FixBit watchface is a mostly faithful recreation of the ["Fix" watchface for Pebble](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/5984653d0dfc3275e20008d5?dev_settings=true&query=Fix&section=watchfaces). All credit for the watchface design goes to Kieseller, who I unfortunately could not contact before creating this watchface. I will never charge for this watchface since it is not my own original design.

### Key Features:
- The fixed dial indicator that gives the illusion of a much larger watchface.
- The indicator color can be selected.
- The _seconds_ indicator can be toggled on and off
- The _hours_ indicator can be configured to move or remain stationary
- The Hour/Minute elements only update when required, optimizing battery usage

### Planned Features:
- [ ] Additional color selection for each component
- [ ] Ability to flip watchface horizontally and rotate as desired
- [ ] 24 hour display
- [ ] Tap to switch between seconds indicator, heartRate, footsteps, and other stats
- [ ] (Maybe?) Always On Display 
  


_Original Description by Kieselleger:_
> The numbers are traveling and the dial is fixed. Enable hours, minutes and seconds. Change the color of all elements on the screen as you like it or enable 24 hour display. Display can be flipped and rotation can be changed as desired.
